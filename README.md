# Word-Guess-Game

                1. User will be shown the blank spots for letters and they have to guess what letter the app is thinking of
                
                2.  Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)
                
                3. Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)
                
                4. Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)
                
                5. Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed.)
                
                6. When the player wins,  Wins will increase.
